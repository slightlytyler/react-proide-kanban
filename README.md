Production-ready boilerplate for building universal, extendable, and reusable React applications with `react-redux-provide`.


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo or copy its files to your own.

2. Replace all occurrences of "lumbur" and "Lumbur" with your own app's name - e.g., replace "lumbur" with "your-own-app" and "Lumbur" with "YourOwnApp".

3. Run `npm install` in the directory.

4. Run `npm run start:dev` for development or `npm start` for production.

5. Build your app within the `src` directory using the existing files as a template.  Searching for `NOTE:` throughout this repo should point you towards the areas of the code you will likely need to customize.  :)

6. Any static files should of course go within the `static` directory, and feel free to replace the `favicon.ico` with your own.

7. Add some tests if you want!  See the `test` directory.

8. Update this README.  ;)
